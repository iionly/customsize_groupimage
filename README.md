Description
-----------

This plugin overrides the display of group profile images by displaying the group profile image in the master thumbnail size instead of large thumbnail size. The master thumbnail size is the same as the size of the uploaded image as long as the width and height of this image is below 10240px. If you upload an image with width 928px you get the group profile image taking the whole available width on the group profile page. The group profile fields are displayed below the group image.


Installation
------------

1. If you have a previous version of the Customsize Groupimage plugin installed, first remove the old customsize_groupimage plugin folder from your mod directory before copying/extracting the new version to your server,
2. Copy the customsize_groupimage plugin folder into the mod folder on your server,
3. Enable the plugin in the admin section of your site.
